  <h3>A web micro-framework written in PureScript</h3>

  <p>Hi! You've found <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-deku">Deku</a>.</p>

  <p>Deku is the coolest web micro-framework that no one knows about yet. Except you, of course, as you're here. So welcome!</p>

  <p>The main goal of Deku is speed. I made it for the purpose of creating interactive web-based musical instruments, but it's equally useful as a general-purpose web framework. Its standard event-handling patterns tend to outperform those of React and Vue by a factor of 1.5-2x.</p>

  <p>This documentation is written in Deku and can be found <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-deku/tree/main/examples/docs">here</a>. One good way to follow along is by using the Deku starter repo, which you can clone <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-deku-starter">here</a>.</p>

  <p>And now, without further ado, check out the <a ~next~ style="cursor:pointer;">hello world section</a>!</p>
