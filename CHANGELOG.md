- Reverts experiment

## [0.2.0] - 2022-04-07

- A failed experiment in creating phantom types around events. Conceptually, this makes no sense. An event should only be gated with a phantom type if it is somehow tightly coupled to the context in which it is executing. Otherwise, each subscription is separate, so there can be as many as you like. If subscriptions cause some sort of saturation, then you'll want to limit the number of events (for example by creating a hot `requestAnimationFrame` at the toplevel rather than several cold ones).

### Removed

- Spurious parammeter in the `SubgraphF` type.

## [0.1.2] - 2022-04-06

### Chore

- Fix `Left` bug in interpret

## [0.1.0] - 2022-03-30

### Breaking change alert!

Changes to a different model that uses less typelevel programming and a more SDOM-y approach, while using similar fine-grained state management to Wags. Read the docs to find out more!
