-- | _The_ type that represents a Deku application. To be used when `Nut` doesn't cut it
-- | (for example, when different locks need to be used because of the use of portals).
-- | The lock and payload variables mean the following this:
-- |
-- | - `lock` is an internal scope that applies to each portal. It is used so that `Domable`-s don't
-- |    escape their scope, which allows them to be automatically memory-managed by Deku. You can think
-- |    of this like Rust's borrow checker.
-- | - `payload` is the backend being used. It changes for SPAs versus SSR. You can also impelement your
-- |    own custom backend if you're doing something exotic (see `Deku.Interpret`).
